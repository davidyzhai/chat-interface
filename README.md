This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First we need to set up a local model. Visit and download ollama https://ollama.com/. 
Use ollama to run llm locally. In terminal,
ollama run llama2 (this will download llama 2 locally if you don't have it). It also exposes an HTTP API on localhost, so we can send requests to this from our application. 

Second, run the development server:
npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
